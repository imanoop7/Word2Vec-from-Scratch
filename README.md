# Word2Vec from Scratch

An implementation of Word2Vec based on the original paper [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781) by Mikolov et al.

## Overview
Word2Vec is a group of neural network models that learn distributed representations of words in vector space, enabling words with similar meanings to have similar representations.
